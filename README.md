# Global_Superstore 
Measuring business performance is a way to assess your current market, access new customers and find new business opportunities. In this project, I will analyze the performance of the Global-Superstore business by reviewing sales, customer, and product overview. Here the dataset I used was dummy data that I got from the Microsoft Practice PowerBI. The dataset represents the number of transactions in Superstores in the (dummy-dataset) during 2011 to 2014, including its features allowing viewing of orders from multiple columns: from sales, discount value, order_date, delivery date, product details and customer information. As I began this project I took into consideration the cycle of a data analysis project : Business Issue Understanding (set up objective and research question), Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Visualization and Analysis and Insights.
